# SDS315_HW9

Located in this repository is my RMD file with all the code for HW9 of SDS315. The CSVs needed to reproduce my results are not located here. To reproduce my results, download SDS315_HW9.RMD and all the CSVs from Canvas and put them all in the same working directory. From there, just run the RMD file. Necessary packages are listed at the top of the RMD file. This should reproduce my HW9 results.
